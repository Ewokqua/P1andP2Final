# P1andP2Final
I've finished the easy and hard projects for HTML/CSS Basics on the Odin Project. I decided to combine the two into one repsoitory, once I update the links within the pages.

Quick note: the links inside all the documents have not been updated yet, so if you pull this, they probably will not work.
I had built this as a side project intended to run locally on my laptop, so the links are specific to my computer.

Still have the training wheels on, so thanks for being patient.
